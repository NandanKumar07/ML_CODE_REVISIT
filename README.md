# Machine Learning Code Revisit

This repository contains code and materials revisiting the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera. The specialization includes three courses:

1. **Supervised Learning**
2. **Advanced Learning Algorithm**
3. **Unsupervised Learning**

## Overview

The code in this repository corresponds to exercises, projects, and examples covered in the respective courses of the Machine Learning Specialization. The goal is to review and reinforce the concepts learned during the specialization.

## Courses

### 1. Supervised Learning

- Code related to supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines.

### 2. Advanced Learning Algorithm

- Implementation and understanding of advanced machine learning algorithms, including neural networks and deep learning.

### 3. Unsupervised Learning

- Code examples and projects focusing on unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering and dimensionality reduction.

## Repository Structure

- `/Supervised_Learning`: Contains code and materials from the Supervised Learning course.
- `/Advanced_Learning_Algorithm`: Code for the Advanced Learning Algorithm course.
- `/Unsupervised_Learning`: Materials related to the Unsupervised Learning course.
